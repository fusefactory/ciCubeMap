# ciCubeMap

A [cinder](https://libcinder.org/) block that provides an high-level API for creating and using cubemap (as well as equirectangular) content in various formats.

## Credits

Most, or at least the initial, logic in this block is based on the [DynamicCubeMapping sample application](https://github.com/cinder/Cinder/tree/master/samples/_opengl/DynamicCubeMapping) in the cinder repository.
